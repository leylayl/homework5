# Reflection on Creating a Jokes App with Offline Fallback

### 1. Your prompts
* "add an offline fallback to this code. if request fail load data from a local json file instead"
* "remove comments"
* "how to create a file in a folder?" (I was stuck on how to actually make the .json file).

### 2. What surprised you
I was surprised that even though my browser was working, Python couldn't reach the website. The AI explained that it was a connection error and showed me how to bypass it. It was also cool that the AI could "write" a JSON file for me to copy-paste when I had no data.

### 3. What was extra
The AI gave me specific Windows terminal commands (like `notepad` and `type`) to manage files. It also explained the logic of "Try/Except" which helped me understand how professional apps handle crashes.

### 4. What you changed
I had to change the code from a simple text storage to a JSON storage because my teacher required a specific format. I also had to fix my mistakes when I tried to run the database file (`jokes_db.json`) as if it were a Python script.

### 5. Your experience
* **What felt easy:** Once the code was right, seeing the joke appear in the terminal felt great.
* **What was confusing:** I was very confused about the file names. I tried to run `python jokes_db.py` but that file didn't exist, and I realized I was mixing up the code file and the data file. It was also hard to understand why the database was "empty" at first.
* **What you learned:** I learned that files need to be in the same folder to work together. I learned that JSON needs specific brackets `[]`. Most importantly, I learned how to create a "Plan B" (fallback) in code.
* **How AI helped you think:** The AI acted like a tutor. When I got an error, it didn't just give me code; it told me *why* the terminal couldn't find my file. It helped me realize that computers are very literal about names and extensions.
* **Confidence:** I feel much better now. At first, the black terminal screen and the "No such file" errors were scary, but now I know how to fix them and how to check what's inside my files.
